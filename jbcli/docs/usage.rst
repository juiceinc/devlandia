=====
Usage
=====

Juicebox CLI is used to make creating, packaging, and deploying juicebox
applications easier.

Applications Commands
=====================

These are the commands for working with your local Juicebox apps. You'll want
to get real friendly with these.

These include day-to-day actions like creating a new apps, adding existing
apps, packaging apps for deployment, and removing apps from your local
Juicebox environment.


add
---

The add command is used to load an existing application. It can take one or more
application names separated by spaces.

If the application is not already found in the application directory, it is
downloaded from Github. It will then load the application into the Juicebox VM,
and optionally add the repo to the Github desktop application.

If you would like to specify a specific branch to use for adding an app, you
can use the syntax `appslug@branchname` and it will clone that branch directly


Options
~~~~~~~

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Option", "Description"
   :widths: 15, 30

   "--add-desktop","Adds the application to the Github desktop app."


Example::

    $ jb add cookies


clone
-----

The clone command is used to create a new Juicebox application by copying an
existing one. It requires the name of an existing application and a name
for the new application.

The command will create an application from an existing application, create a
local git repo inside the newly created application directory, setup a pointer
to a remote Github repo, push the data to that Github repo.

Often you'll want to follow this command with the ``add`` command.

Options
~~~~~~~

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Option", "Description"
   :widths: 15, 30

   "--no-init","Skip creating a local git repo and remote setup."
   "--no-track","Skip pointing and pushing to a remote Github repo."


Example::

    $ jb clone cookies sugar_cookies


remove
------

The remove command deletes an application from the Juicebox VM and the apps
folder on your machine. The command can take one or more application names
separated by spaces. It will require you to confirm the deletion.

Options
~~~~~~~

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Option", "Description"
   :widths: 15, 30

   "--yes","Automatically confirm the prompt prior to deleting."


Example::

    $ jb remove sugar_cookies --yes



clear_cache
-----------

The clear_cache command allows you to clear the Juicebox cache inside the Docker
container. The command can take one or more application names separated by spaces.

Example::

    $ jb clear_cache


pull
----

The pull command allows you to explicitly download a specific version of the Juicebox container
by specifying the tag.  Implementors will probably not use this very much directly
(it is used behind the scenes to automatically keep your environment up to date), but
the option is there if you need a specific version.

Example::

    $ jb pull stable



manage
------

The manage command allows you to run arbitrary management commands inside the container.

Options
~~~~~~~

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Option", "Description"
   :widths: 15, 30

   "--options/-o","Options you want to pass to the test command."


Example::

    $ jb manage test --keepdb --failfast

This will run ``python manage.py test --keepdb --failfast`` inside the container.

Environment Commands
====================

These commands are for working with your local Juicebox environment. This
includes running the project watcher, working with Docker, and running
the Django dev server.

ls
--

By default this command only lists tagged images available within the last 30 days.

Options
~~~~~~~

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Option", "Description"
   :widths: 15, 30

   "--showall","Shows all tagged images available regardless of time."
   "--semantic", "Only shows the semantically versioned (release) images."

Example::

    $ jb ls --semantic

      Image Name    Digest                                                            Time Tagged

Will show all semantically tagged versions.

select
------

Used in conjunction with ``jb ls``, will rewrite the docker-compose.yml file in the environment allowing you to switch between tagged images easily.

Example::

    $ jb select 3.16.0

      Making sure we're in the Juicebox test environment...

watch
-----

This will start the Juicebox project watcher so that changes will be reloaded
as you make them as well as run ``make jswatch`` in a separate thread to detect JS changes.

Example::

    $ jb watch

Please see the install guide for instructions on installing requirements for
the watcher.


start
-----

This command will start your Juicebox VM if it is not already running.  The default behavior automatically
checks for a newer image for the environment you're currently in so you are always on the latest version.
This can be suppressed with the --noupdate flag.

Options
~~~~~~~

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Option", "Description"
   :widths: 15, 30

   "--noupdate","Whether or not to automatically download image updates."


Example::

    $ jb start
    or
    $ jb start --noupdate

stop
----

This command will stop your Juicebox VM if it is already running.

Options
~~~~~~~

None

Example::

    $ jb stop



Built-in Help
